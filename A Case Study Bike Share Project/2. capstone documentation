SCENARIO

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders(without annual membership) and annual members(with annual membership) use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
